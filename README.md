*FRONT-END*

#SIMULATING A LOGIN PROCESS 

For this project, you are expected to create/simulate a login process for a
normal website. The user flow is as follows.

*• User A searches your site by inputting the link on the search bar, and is
greeted by your lovely homepage.
• Among the aesthetics on this lovely homepage, user A can see two
buttons, (Home and Login).
• User A clicks on the login, and is directed to a page, with two form inputs
(email address and password).
• User A inputs a wrong credential (eg: email: uobis@gmail.com, password:
12345678) and is shown an error message saying he has inputted the
wrong credentials.
• User A scurries around, and finds his correct credentials stashed
somewhere, and now he inputs these (eg: email: gabriel@gmail.com,
password: password ) and he is logged in successfully, and redirected to
a simple page named Dashboard.
Optional Tasks:
• Add a sign-out button on the dashboard page.
• persist user information after login.
• extend valid credentials for login to a list of possible inputs.
• prevent access to our simple dashboard page for anonymous users.*

**REQUIREMENTS FOR THE FRONTEND TASK TO RUN SUCCESSFULLY**

#You will need to use a modern Browser , Chrome or Mozilla Firefox preferably
#You will require a text editor like visual studio code with a live server installed
#The concept of localStorage was used to implement a temporary storage of userData
#All validations were done on the client side using purely Vanilla Javascript 
#Hashing of User password was done via string manipulation

*BACK-END*

For this project, here is a list of basic operations you are expected to code into
your stack.

*• Push - this operation allows you to insert an element into the stack.
• Pop - this operation allows you to remove an element from the stack.
• Peek - this operation returns the top element in the stack (by top I mean
the element to be returned next by the pop operation)
• isEmpty - returns true or false, if the stack is empty or not.
• Size - returns the size of the stack.*

**REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BACKEND TASK TO RUN SUCCESSFULLY**

#You will require a text editor like visual studio code 
#You will also need python version 3.2 and above installed on your pc
